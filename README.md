  <p>
    This is the computational assignment given in the course of Differential Equations Fall 2018 in Innopolis University.
    The goal of the assignment is to learn approximating numerical calculations of solutions of differential equations with 3 methods:
    <ul>
      <li>Euler's method</li>
      <li>Improved Euler's method</li>
      <li>Runga-Kutta method</li>
    </ul>
    draw their plot and compare the results with exact solution.

  <h3>Technical specification</h3>
  <p>The GUI application is written in C++ with <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt.</a>
    The reason I chose Qt is it is cross-platform and very powerful. It has relatively good libraries to plot charts which makes the task easier.   
  </p>
  <p>The application can be compiled using Qt Creator which has open-source(with LGPL license) version. It is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS in <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt's</a> official website. You can find information about installation process of Qt Creator below. Once you have installed the Qt Creator you should open <strong>diffeq.pro</strong> file and click Run icon in the bottom left corner or in the <strong>build</strong> menu.

  <h3>
    Executable files
  </h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Linux executable.zip</strong> and <strong>Windows executable.zip</strong> files store executable files in corresponding platforms. These files are compiled from exactly the same code as in this repository using Qt Creator. Linux version of the executable might have some dependency issues while using in some linux distros.
